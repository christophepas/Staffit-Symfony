[Staffit](https://www.staffit.co) - test your Symfony2 skills with puppies
===================================

Welcome to the Symfony skill assessment by Staffit. As you can see, this git repository contains a raw symfony2 project. During this test, you can access all your usuals work ressources : feel free to use the [documentation](http://symfony.com/doc/current/index.html), Stackoverflow or to google anything. The purpose of this test is to catch a glimpse of your skills in real conditions. 

What's your job ?
-----------------
In no more than 1 hour, you will have to create **a web app allowing veterinarians to deal with their appointments**. Never thought you would have to do that once in your life, did you ? 
Your goal is to create the most clean and maintanable system, within the allocated time. The 2 main following features are mandatories: 
- The veterinarian can visualize the appointments and sort them.
- His assistants can create new appointments. 

Process
-------
1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) me
2. Create a topic branch - `git checkout -b my_awesome_branch`
3. Write your code and nail it !
4. Push to your branch - `git push origin my_awesome_branch`
5. Create a [Pull Request](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/) from your branch
6. Once your project done, we will send you links to 3 other versions of the same project. You will have to assess them on a given scale, and **your ability to assess will be part of your assessment**.
7. Sit back and relax ;)
